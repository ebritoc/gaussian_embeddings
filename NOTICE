 This work is based on word2vec (https://code.google.com/archive/p/word2vec/).
 
 The learning method implemented in learn.c is based on word2vec.c after the following modifications:
 - The network weights (syn_0 and syn_1) are extended so that they can contain a diagonal covariance matrix.
 - The gradient calculations were adapted according to a max-margin loss function with either Expected Likelihood energy or KL divergence energy.
 - All weight values are now randomly initizalized.
 - Introduction of an adaptative learning rate to each weight value (transition from SGD to AdaGrad).
 - Introduction of mini-batch learning with variable size. The size of the batch can be determined by the user.
 - Removal of all non-used features for our model such as the construction of a Huffman tree with the vocabulary and the K-means algorithm.
 
 Modifications of distance.c:
- The tool now processes the embeddings containing a covariance matrix.
- The distance between two embeddings can be computed not only by means of cosine distance but also with the expected likelihood energy.

The tool specificity.c is derived from distance.c after the following modifications:
- It finds now the 100 nearest embeddings.
. It orders the found embeddings by descending variance.
